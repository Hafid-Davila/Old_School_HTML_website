### This project is a work in progress! 

My personal website is my first real coding project and I am so freaking excited! üòÉ

*(Updated: 28/07/2022)*

I am using the skills that I have acquired by putting in practice what I have learned in [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://github.com/angelabauer/web-development-bootcamp) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://twitter.com/yu_angela). Like I said before this project is a work in progress and I don't know what is next. I will continue to update this part of the repository, at least once a week, with all my progress.  

##### *Dr. Angela Yu if you are reading this. Thank you so much!*

This project has come to a haul! Just kidding! üòÅ <br>  
All jokes aside. This project is part of my learning experience, but it has served its purpose as far as "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp" is concerned.  So what I will continue to do with this project is to build my ultimate 90s website, remember the [1996 Space Jam Website](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/). <br> 

Yeah just like that!
